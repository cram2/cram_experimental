;; TODO: spatial-relations-cm defines pose validators for FOR-ON relations.
;; These validators reject solutions from the result below.
;; SOLUTION: either create pose validators specific for costmaps,
;; OR, which is better, make sure costmap validators know they are validating results
;; from the costmap. But how to do this??
